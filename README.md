# ðŸ¥¤ gulp-vite minimal example

Vite build system may not suit everyone, because of limiting entry options

So here is Vite used as web server and gulp for build with Esbuild

Vite and Esbuild can run any format you want - javascript, typescript, postcss, sass, less, stylus

This is a minimal starting example that can be extended as needed

```sh
npm i && npx gulp serve
```

```sh
npx gulp --tasks
```
